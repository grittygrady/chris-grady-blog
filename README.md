## 🚀 [Live Site](LINK HERE)

A blog for personal and professional-ish purposes.

## 💡 Motivation

Establishing an online presence, as well as the fact that I've never actually had a personal blog! I wanted a place to showcase my projects and thoughts, both coding related and otherwise. Something less "businesslike" than my portfolio site, but still showing my love of coding.

## 🤔 The Problem

Establishing an online presence across multiple platforms is tedious and time consuming - I absolutely understand its value, but the D.R.Y. principle kicks in and I'd love a centralized place for all of my content, which can then be used on my LinkedIn and other professional / social networking sites.

I don't want to have to edit the code for my portfolio multiple times a week for things as simple as a post about the GreenSock animation library. A full-stack app is overkill for this purpose, so as the infomercials say, "There **_has_** to be a better way!"

## 🧐 The Solution

A Content Management System! I've never worked with one before, it was never touched upon in my curriculum at Thinkful, so this was an excellent opportunity to give it a whirl. I've decided to try [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/), as I plan on deploying to Netlify, and using their CMS may be **too** easy, and not refelective of future on the job challenges. I considered Wordpress for the sake of its prevalence as legacy software, but the scope of learning that topic seems a bit large at the moment, and I'd like to get this off the ground quicly.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- CMS Systems

  > As ridiculous as this sounds, I genuinely did not know how a client would go about updating their website - particularly a blog or e-commerce / service site. I knew there _had_ to be a way that didn't involve digging in the code, I just waasn't exposed to them anymore.

- Frameworks / Libraries and Mobile Design

  > When using a styling library (for this I used TailwindCSS), mobile first view becomes particularly important, because these tools allow one to put together an impressive page quickly, with animations / pre-built components, etc; however, it's quite easy to paint yourself into a corner when you first put your beautiful desktop site into mobile view and nearly have an aneurysm.

- Tree Shaking

  > Yeah write about that bundle size optimization

## 💾 Tech Used

- React / React Router
- Sanity.io for a CMS
- TailwindCSS
- Deployed via Netlify

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Integrate a system that allows for content to be shared across multiple platforms simultaneously, perhaps ITTT (If That Then This, an automation platform) will work, although I've never tried it with LinkedIn.
